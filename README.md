# Mandelbrot-Pi
Intuitive explanation of phenomenon of Pi hiding in Mandelbrot set cusp

These are my notes and a little visualisation of problem inspired by Numberphile video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0vY0CKYhPY. I felt unsatisfied with quite laconic explanation. I've read a proof of stated convergence, but found it too technically oriented to enjoy. Therefore I've done some own contribution for better understanding of this fun phenomenon. 

The gist is the distance between red dots on y axis of upper plot. The lower plot ilustrates the 'path' of point escaping from critical circle.

I'll complete the description and notes in pdf (translate them also) when I have some more spare time.
